The game source for 'Spin-Doctor', a game made by a class at Futureworks for our first group project in our second year. The game code was written by Ben Griffiths with the editor started by Sam Abblet and finished by Ben.

The game is a puzzle platformer where the player has to rotate the levels to navigate through the environments to try to escape the dungeons.

The game was initially created on XNA using Farseer Physics (a Box2D C# conversion).
