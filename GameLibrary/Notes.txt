[ Collision Group Assignments ]
	Most objects - Collision group 20.
	PlayerBody - Collision group 10.



[ Questions ]
	Should grabbing the ladder grabbing be togglable or should the player have to hold the button.



[ Random Notes ]
	It may be a bit of a weird thing to do but because some features use percentage modifers on the X,Y of thumbsticks, we may have to use them also on the FPS for sprite animation for players.


[ To do ]

	implement sound cues (probably one of the last things to do),
	better commenting on piston,
	look into bouncepad collision (playing sound when contact should be false),
